## Good

- Doki Doki Literature Club
- Prey
- PUBG
- Uncharted: Lost Legacy

## Meh

- Ghost Recon: Wildlands = Spots of greatness followed by open world bore

## Disliked

- Destiny 2 - Mindless grinding and nonsense story
- SW: BF2 - just pay 2 win garbage with basically no fun gameplay.
- Mass Effect: Andromeda = A game so close to being a good ME game, that
trips every time before it achieves greatness. Hurt further by the
cancellation of its trilogy it sets up.
- Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop - Just not my cup of tea I guess
- Fortnite = Dull horde mode: the game

## Couldn't get into

- Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice
- Sonic Mania
