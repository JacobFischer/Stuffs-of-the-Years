## Disliked

## Should have played more

- The Outer Wilds = Put a few hours into. Not 100% sure what I'm doing still.
Pretty chill and unique but not hooking me.
- John Wick Hex
- Rebel Galaxy Outlaw

## Wanted to play but never got to

- Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3
- Days Gone
- The Legends of Zelda: Link's Awakening
- Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey
- Disco Elysium
- Dragon Quest Builders 2

## Ongoing games

- Overwatch = Still great but getting salty and stale
- Halo MCC released Reach DLC and it's [still] awesome. Easily most improved
game post launch in a while.

## Early access

- Slay The Spire = more of a 2018 game but technically released this year
- Satisfactory = Still in EA, love it thus far.
- Subnautica: Below Zero = eagerly awaiting full release

## Old games I finally played

- Moonlighter + Between Dimensions DLC = Would be in lower GOTY list because
it's pretty fun, but came out last year.
- Forza Horizon 4 = I wanted an excuse to use racing wheel. Good game for
that.
- My Time at Portia = Animations distrube me for some reason. Didn't get far.
- Sunset Overdrive = Neat style, ok gameplay. Dialog got grating. ALso didn't
like having to always worry about being in motion.
- Wizard of Legend = Sharp pixel art. Rougelike. Neat but hard to get a good
build. Didn't hook me.
- Factorio = Amazing game. But didn't consume my life as I feared.

## Hyped for next year

- Seeing new consoles + prices and the tech advances that come with them to
all games
- Halo Infinite! (and on PC!!!)
- Animal Crossing: New Horizons
- Cyberpunk 2077
